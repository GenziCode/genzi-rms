**Author:** Antigravity (Senior Fullstack Architect)

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the **Roles & Permissions** module into a world-class, enterprise-grade system. This involves a complete UI/UX redesign, backend expansion to 100+ granular permissions, and robust integration.

## 🏗️ Architectural Roadmap

### Phase 1: Documentation & Structure (✅ In Progress)
- Establish `RoadMap-Full-Documentation` standard.
- Define naming conventions and serialization.

### Phase 2: Backend Core Expansion (🧠 The Brain)
- **Permissions**: Expand from basic CRUD to granular capability-based permissions (100+).
  - Categories: POS, Inventory, CRM, HR, Finance, Settings, Reporting, System.
- **Role Engine**: Enhance `RoleService` to support:
  - Role Inheritance (e.g., Senior Manager extends Manager).
  - Temporal Access (Time-bound roles).
  - Granular Scopes (Store-level, Department-level).

### Phase 3: Frontend Revolution (✨ The Face)
- **Design System**: Implement "Glassmorphism" inspired, clean, high-contrast enterprise UI.
- **Components**:
  - **Role Hub**: A card-based overview with rich metadata.
  - **Permission Matrix 2.0**: A grouped, searchable, and visual permission editor.
  - **Scope Selector**: Visual tree-selector for defining access scopes.
- **UX Improvements**:
  - Wizard for Role Creation.
  - Real-time validation.
  - "View As" capability (simulation).

### Phase 4: Integration & Quality Assurance
- End-to-End testing of the new permission system.
- Verify "Owner" and "Admin" super-access.
- Audit logging for security compliance.

## 📅 Timeline
- **Start**: 2025-11-23 13:55
