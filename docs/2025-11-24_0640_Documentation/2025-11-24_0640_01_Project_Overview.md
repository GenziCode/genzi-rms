# 📋 Project Overview – Genzi RMS (Generated on 2025‑11‑24 06:40)

## ✅ What’s Completed

- **Backend** – 95 % of core APIs are implemented (144 endpoints, 20 models, 20 services, 20 controllers).  Critical modules such as Authentication, Invoices, Files, Notifications, Audit Logs, Payments, Webhooks, and Tenant Management are **fully functional**.
- **Frontend** – 90 % of core UI pages are live (Authentication, Dashboard, Products, Categories, POS, Inventory, Customers, Vendors, Purchase Orders, Users, Settings, Reports).
- **Infrastructure** – Multi‑tenant architecture, JWT auth, rate‑limiting middleware, MongoDB + Redis setup, CI/CD pipelines, and basic dev environment scripts.

## ❌ What’s Still Missing

| Area | Missing Feature | Impact |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Backend** | Public API & SDK (API‑key management, rate‑limiting per key, Swagger/OpenAPI docs, SDK generation) | Optional but needed for third‑party integration |
| **Frontend** | Invoice Management UI, Notification Center UI, Payment UI, Audit‑Log Viewer, Webhook Config UI, User Profile Page | Critical to expose backend functionality to users |
| **Future** | E‑Commerce storefront, Customer Portal | Low priority for now |
